# MeetingReminder

A program that reminds you of meetings

*Only tested on Mac with bash; you need to have Python 3*

## How it works:

To create a meeting, run ```create.py``` and answer the questions.
If you want to see a list of the meeting, execute ```list.py```.
To make the program remind you of a meeting at the right time, run ```python3 remind.py '{meeting-name}'```.
